# Arlathan Discord Announcements

Below are templates for announcements and posts made during the various stages of the
exchange. For use with [carlbot](https://carl.gg/)

A brief guide to using embeds with Carl can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vh4TDt-28M-mDBXp6NS8N6SCxd_bS_Qo75dBRrmr6R0/edit?usp=sharing).

**To Update the Template:** Replace the full `#Placeholder#` with the expected
text. links are wrapped in angle brackets `< >` to prevent embeds from posting.

After updating, links should look like:

```markdown
[I am a link.](https://url.com)
```
