# Tags & Tag Approvals

When approving tags to tag sets we need to review the following:

- [ ] Does the tag meet the requirement of the exchange, i.e. is there an elf?, is
      it poly?, etc.

- [ ] Does the tag meet our nominations requirements?

  - **Both**

    - [ ] Do OCs/PCs have a gender and last name/origin i.e. Female Hawke, Male
          Tabris (not Male Warden)?

    - [ ] Do general OCs end in `(s)`, i.e. Original Grey Warden Character(s),
          Pride Demon(s), Agent(s) of Fen'harel?

  - **Arlathan**

    - [ ] Is a character tag listed as Character (Solo), i.e. Solas (Solo)?

- [ ] If there is a canon tag, has it been selected? (Check to see if there are
      AO3 suggestions.)

- [ ] Are character names spelled correctly? (This error can be caught by the
      spreadsheet and corrected on the backend, but try to catch it upfront if
      possible!)

- [ ] Do tags fit the below **Tags Formatting** guidelines?

If there are questions about tags, refer to [More Specifics](#more-specifics) and [Tags Troubleshooting](#tags-troubleshooting) below.

## Tags Formatting

Characters are placed in the tag alphabetically by:

- Last Name (including protagonists; ignore Female/Male/Nonbinary except for
  when last name is the same)

  - Mac Tir is treated as compound

  - Orlesian ‘de’ names are not treated as compound (‘Chalons’ not ‘de Chalons’)

  - A character with ‘of X’ is alphabetized as ‘X’, e.g. ‘Serault’ for Frederic
    of Serault

  - Adorno Ciel Otranto is ‘Otranto’

- Single Name

  - Ignore titles (Cauthrien, not Ser Cauthrien) unless character name is _only_
    a title (His Dour Lordship)

  - Ser Pounce-a-Lot is ordered by his full name (‘Ser’ not ‘Pounce’)

  - Ignore ‘The’ for all characters (The Iron Bull is ordered as ‘Iron Bull’)

  - Descriptors do not count as last names (‘Svarah Sun-Hair’ not 'Sun-Hair')

- Original characters are ordered as ‘O’

  - All original characters should have Character(s) to finish the name, i.e.
    Original Templar Character(s)

- Type of Demon/Spirit needs to be specified and have (s); does not need to have
  Original

  - The _specific_ spirit in Solas’ quest is ‘Wisdom’; other such spirits are
    Wisdom Spirit(s)

- Possessives are in alphabetical order, e.g., Hawke’s Mabari is treated as
  coming right after all other Hawkes.

- Groups are also in alphabetical order, e.g., Agent(s) of Fen'harel are
  alphabetized with 'A' and Inquisition Scout(s) are alphabetized with 'I'.

## More Specifics

_For Black Emporium:_

- Fen’Harel is treated as synonymous with Solas (no evidence that they were ever
  two distinct people).

- Mythal and Flemeth can be nominated as two separate characters (since Flemeth
  took on the mantle of Mythal).

_For Arlathan eXchange and DA Poly Exchange:_

- Fen'Harel and Solas can be requested as two entities (for time travel
  shenanigans or magical accidents). i.e. Fen'harel/Female Lavellan/Solas can be
  nominated as an eligible tag.

- Mythal and Flemeth can also be nominated as two separate characters

## Tags Troubleshooting

- You can look up the AO3 canonical tags for characters by using [Tags Search](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/search). This is especially useful if you are questioning how the character is listed in a nominated tag.

  - If you find misspellings or duplicate tags, please send [AO3 support](https://archiveofourown.org/support) an message. Dragon Age tag wranglers are used to getting reports from me at this point.

- If you are unsure about a character, use the
    [wiki](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Age_Wiki) to determine race for eligibility for Arlathan eXchange, spelling of name, or other nomination details.
