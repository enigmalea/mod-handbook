# Arlathan Tumblr Announcements

Below are templates for announcements made during the various stages of the
exchange. When posting to tumblr, paste the template into the **Rich Text Editor** to preserve formatting.

**To Update the Template:** Replace the full `#Placeholder#` with the expected
text. links are wrapped in angle brackets `< >` to prevent embeds from posting.

After updating, links should look like:

```markdown
[I am a link.](https://url.com)
