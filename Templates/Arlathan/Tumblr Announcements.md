# Arlathan Tumblr Announcements

Below are templates for announcements made during the various stages of the
exchange. When posting to tumblr, paste the template into the **Rich Text Editor** to preserve formatting.

**To Update the Template:** Replace the full `#Placeholder#` with the expected
text. links are wrapped in angle brackets `< >` to prevent embeds from posting.

After updating, links should look like:

```markdown
[I am a link.](https://url.com)
```

A golden magical light flies around the text wrapping around it and sparkling as if by magic.](https://github.com/enigmalea/mod-handbook/blob/main/Images/Banners%20and%20Ads/Arlathan%20eXchange/AdMain.gif?raw=true)
