## About Nominations
```markdown
# Nomination Reminders!

<@&946087296829124643> Hello everyone! With just under a week left in the nominations period, we wanted to share a few reminders about nominations for this exchange:

→ Tags **must** be nominated to the #year# tagset if you want to use them in your sign-up. Canonical tags are not included by default and while some tags were carried over from previous years' exchanges, many were not. Double-check that your favorite is part of the 2024 tagset! 

→ Nominating tags does **not** mean you have to sign up for the exchange! Even if you're not participating, you can nominate tags to encourage others to create for ships you like. You can also nominate ships that you might want to create treats for!

→ Tags must include at least one Elvhen character to be accepted and OC/PC characters must include a gender & background (i.e. Female Surana, Male Lavellan)

→ You are not limited to existing canonical tags! As long as your tag meets our other requirements, you can manually type it into the nominations box and we will add it to the tagset. Go wild, rarepair and minor NPC lovers! :raised_hands:

For more details, see our Nominations Tutorial here: [How to Nominate](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/nominate). You can also <#946087298502639662> if you have any questions! Or ask questions anonymously via our Tumblr askbox: [Anon ask](https://arlathanxchange.tumblr.com/ask).

  **Nominated Tags:** [gSheets](<#link#>) | [ao3](<#link#>) | [autoao3app](<#link#>)

## REMINDERS

☆ **Be careful when editing your sign up!! AO3 has been known to add "Additional Tags" to your selections.** This means that if you go back in to edit, it may select "Fanart", "Fanfiction", or other tags that you did not want it to. If you edit your sign up, please double-check your requests very carefully to make sure they are accurate. If you discover an issue AFTER assignments go out, please let a mod know immediately.

☆ **If you signed up with any Treats related tag on your OFFERS, please do the mods a favor and remove those tags.** We would really appreciate your help with that!

☆ **Creators are not required to follow provided prompts, so please do not expect prompts to keep you "safe" from your triggers, squicks, etc.** Because of this, it is *highly recommended* that you include Do Not Wants or a letter listing them in each request. Please try to make DNWs as specific as possible. 

☆ **If you are requesting a tag with an OC and are asking for a specific OC,** please be sure to include a link to information and/or art references for that OC.

☆ **Don't forget you can tailor your offers to requests that have already been made.** Choosing to offer ships that are already being requested will help to ensure that you'll receive a match!

 **__If you have questions before signing up you can:__**
  ☆ [check out the sign-up tutorial!](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/signups>)

# ✨Creators Have Been Revealed!✨

<@&946087296829124643>

**Creators, you can start claiming your works!** You can add your works to personal collections and series on AO3, thank your betas, link to your social media accounts, swap out unsigned art, and/or share your work(s) on social media! 

Feel free to tag @arlathanxchange and we will share your works on our account! If your work contains healthy polyamory, you can also tag @dapolyshipping and we will reblog it over there. 

**Reminders & Info**

☆ If you haven't already, please make sure to comment on your main gift! While you are not *required* to comment on treats, if you cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main gift, you should comment on both. **It is good etiquette to comment on all gifts received.**

☆ **The collection will remain open for treats!** You can post treats to any of the Arlathan eXchange collections at any time.

☆ The mods of Arlathan eXchange will also be hosting the DA Poly Exchange for healthy polyamory! Follow us on Tumblr at [@dapolyshipping](https://www.tumblr.com/dapolyshipping) for upcoming announcements and event info.

# #YEAR# Treatless List is Live! 

<@&946087296829124643> If you're interested in creating treats and would like to focus on participants who have not yet received one, our #YEAR# Treatless List is now available!

[View the Treatless List here!](#LINK TO TREATLESS LIST#)

☆ Treats are works created in addition to your assignment - they are extra gifts! Treats can be gifted to one person, multiple people, or the exchange as a whole, depending on who has requested the pairing you create for and recipients' DNWs.

☆ Treats have relaxed requirements for length and style! [Check out our FAQs for specific guidelines](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/faqs#treats)

☆ For more information on treats, check out our [Treats & Treatless FAQ](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/treats)

## Comment Reminder
```markdown

# Reminder to Comment! 

<@&946087296829124643> As we gear up for creator reveals, please make sure you've left a comment of at least one sentence on your main gift! While you are not *required* to comment on treats, if you cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main gift, you should comment on both. **It is good etiquette to comment on all gifts received.** 

Leaving comments can be difficult, so gif responses and memes are okay, but if you use those, please also add a few words to thank your creator for their hard work!

Please see our website, [FAQs: Help! I didn't get a comment!](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/faqs#no-comment>), for more information on comments and commenting requirements.
