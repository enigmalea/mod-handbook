# Reminder to Comment!

As we gear up for creator reveals tomorrow, please make sure you've left a comment of at least one sentence on your main gift! While you are not *required* to comment on treats, if you cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main gift, you should comment on both. **It is good etiquette to comment on all gifts received.** 

Leaving comments can be difficult, so gif responses and memes are okay, but if you use those, please also add a few words to thank your creator for their hard work!

Please see our website, [FAQs: Help! I didn't get a comment!](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/faqs#no-comment>), for more information on comments and commenting requirements.
