I face-planted into the Dragon Age fandom back in 2021 after my best friend showed me a PowerPoint about how Solas broke their heart and I haven't left since. The community is what keeps me here and I'm thrilled to be part of events that keep that supporitve spirit of creation alive! 

I'm a fanfiction writer and avid multishipper with enough OCs and world states that I need a spreadsheet to keep them organized. The gray areas between canon events are my playground and my favorite stories are canon divergence that *bend* the lore without *breaking* it. I'm a sucker for found family and sibling dynamics and I love when characters are complicated and messy. 

I've played and love all three games, but if I tried to pick a favorite we'd be here a while. Mages, elves, and rogues are my go-to blorbos, but I've yet to meet a Dragon Age character I don't like in some capacity. 

I'm excited to join the Arlathan eXchange mod team this year and can't wait to see what everyone creates!
