# ☆ Mod Intro

▸ Name: Enigmalea 
▸ Pronouns: any

I'm a fandom old who's been involved in internet fandom in some shape or form since right around the time the internet became available for home use in the ancient days. I took a long break from fandom, but when I finally came back in earnest around 2019, I threw myself wholeheartedly into the DA fandom.

I'm primarily a writer, but I also love to run projects, events, and communities. I dabble in coding and graphic design. At any given time I have a chaotic mass of projects and deadlines happening all at once.

I have a hard time picking favorite characters or ships or tropes. I'm a hopeless multishipper who loves throwing everyone into poly configurations and seeing what shenanigans I can cook up.

I'm looking forward to modding Arlathan eXchange again this year and can't wait to see what everyone creates!
