A banner that says "Arlathan eXchange 72-hours reminder" in a script font overlays an ancient elven fresco mural. The mural depicts two elves on either side of the painting, framing seven bursts in alternating blue and gold that arc around bottom of a light blue background decorated with evenly spaced small red flares; in the center is a circle with a black background, and 14 pillar-like items with red eyes staring a red disk with a star pattern in the center.
