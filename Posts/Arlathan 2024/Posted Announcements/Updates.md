# Important Changes and Updates!

<@&946087296829124643>: With less than **one week** until nominations, we have some changes and updates to share!

### ☆ *rules & faq changes*

> → We have added and clarified some of the rules regarding AI and NSFW works, as well as updated the guidelines on gift giving and our commenting policy on received works.

### ☆ *nominations changes*

> → This year we will pre-load ships and characters that have been nominated for both prior rounds of Arlathan, so you can free up your nominations spaces for other characters/ships.

### ☆ *sign-up changes*

> → The **minimum** number of requests and offers has been increased to 3. We have also removed the limit on offers, so participants can offer to their heart's content!
>
> → Clarification has been added regarding OC requests. Requests should not be designed to force a creator to create ONLY for your specific OC. Writing/drawing someone else's OC can be an intimidating process that creators may not be comfortable with. Please be sure to include at least one ship where you are open to either general OCs or canon characters. 

### ☆ *other changes*

> → Please send communications regarding individual circumstances via email or the official extension form. With the larger mod team, we will no longer be taking **personal** communications about the exchange via Discord DM or tumblr DM/ask. **General** questions can still be asked in discord or via tumblr ask.
> 
> → There will be a separate treatless list this year.
> 
> → A tutorial about AO3 & Non-Fanfic Works has been added, including resources for hosting multimedia works.
>
>  →  Links on both discord and tumblr have been updated for 2024!

A golden magical light flies around the text wrapping around it and sparkling as if by magic.](https://github.com/enigmalea/mod-handbook/blob/main/Images/Banners%20and%20Ads/Arlathan%20eXchange/AdMain.gif?raw=true)
