# Arlathan Discord Ads

Below are templates for ads we use for advertising various stages of the
exchange in other DA Discords. We tend to update these general ads yearly and
share in other DA Discords as appropriate. Please be sure to follow the
Discord's rules for advertising.

When posting, upload the
[Ad Banner](https://replit.com/@enigmalea/mod-handbook#Images/Banners%20and%20Ads/Arlathan%20eXchange/AdMain.gif)
first.

**To Update the Template:** Replace the full `#Placeholder#` with the expected
text. links are wrapped in angle brackets `< >` to prevent embeds from posting.

After updating links should look like:

```markdown
[I am a link.](https://url.com)
```
