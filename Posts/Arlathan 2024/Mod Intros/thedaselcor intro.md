Well, with a name like ThedasElcor I clearly have no interest in the bioware fandom (humorous sarcasm). I joined Arlathan as a Hanged Man mod because these events are one of the few things that get me out of my rabbit hole and interacting with other people. 

In terms of what I like within the fandom... well, I've never made a decision in my life and I don't intend to start now, but one of my top faves is HardAssi shipping (Lace Harding and Cremisius Aclassi). And making things poly... almost any time poly is explicitly allowed in a request I find a way to make a big 'ole spider web from it. 

Realistically, I'm an ADHD hobby goblin--I collect favourite characters and ships, fandoms, coding hobbies, yarn related hobbies, literally all the hobbies. I think if I sit still for two minutes I'll explode. This also means I tend to do things in my own corner, so finding a way to turn my hobby-collecting obsession into something that can help the dragon age fandom was a neat little surprise. Let's see what happens.

I forget to check my socials  a lot, but you could theoretically find me on:
- [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/thedaselcor)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/decalte)
- [dreamwidth](https://thedaselcor.dreamwidth.org/)
And, of course, you can always find me in several many fandom spaces on discord.
