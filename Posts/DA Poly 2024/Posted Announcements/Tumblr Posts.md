# **Dragon Age Polyshipping is Back!** 

:sparkles: Join us for the 2024 exchange! :sparkles: 

Are you a fan creator looking for Dragon Age poly content? Hoping to expand the AO3 tag for your favorite throuple? Or maybe you look at the Inner Circle and think: "they're all just too pretty to choose"?

If so, this exchange is for you! 

DA Polyshipping is a celebration of healthy polyamorous, polysexual, and polygamous ships in the Dragon Age fandom. It is open to all creators who are willing to create one piece of fanart or write one fanfic that meets our exchange requirements and deadlines!  
> The exchange focuses on healthy polyamory in all its forms and welcomes queerplatonic relationships, one-time theesomes (or moresomes), and long-term relationships. Check out [FAQ - What do you mean by healthy polyamory?](https://dapolyshipping.neocities.org/docs/exchange/faq#what-do-you-mean-by-healthy-polyamory) for more details on acceptable pieces. 

NOMINATIONS OPEN IN 4 WEEKS! 

## **Important Changes & Updates**

- This year we will pre-load ships and characters that have been nominated for all prior years of DA Polyshipping, so you can free up your nominations spaces for other characters/ships.
- **Nominations will only be open for one week!**
- Welcome new mods, @inquisimer & @plisuu! With the larger mod team, we will no longer be taking **personal** communications about the exchange via Discord DM or tumblr DM/ask. Please send communications regarding individual circumstances via email or the official extension form. **General** questions can still be asked in discord or via tumblr ask.
