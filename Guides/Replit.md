# Using Replit

You can set up your workspace any way you like. In general, we recommend using
the left pane to write in and the right pane to preview.

## To Begin Writing:

1. Click on the file you would like to edit on the left hand files pane.
2. On the right hand pane click the `+`.
3. Type the name of the file to begin searching.
4. When you find the file, click on it.
5. A new tab opens with the file.
6. To switch to preview mode, click on the eye icon.

You may add as many work panes as you like.
