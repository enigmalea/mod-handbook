# Using Replit

You can set up your workspace any way you like. In general, we recommend using
the left pane to write in and the right pane to preview.

## To Begin Writing:

1. Click on the file you would like to edit on the left hand files pane.
2. On the right hand pane click the `+`.
3. Type the name of the file to begin searching.
4. When you find the file, click on it.
5. A new tab opens with the file.
6. To switch to preview mode, click on the eye icon.

You may add as many work panes as you like.

## Markdown Reference

Replit has some additional options for markdown including allowing us to have
excalidraw canvases displayed directly in our markdown or allowing us to insert
embeds of videos and more. For more information on all of these options see
[Using Markdown on Replit](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/replit/markdown).
