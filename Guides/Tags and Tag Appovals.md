## Approving Tags

1. Go to the tag set.
2. Click on "Review Nominations".
> **NOTE:** 2024 Arlathan only - because we know that AO3 is having tags approval issues, please copy the tags to another document somewhere before you begin approving. Worst case scenario we can batch load them if AO3 is being a jerk.

3. Review the list of nominated tags one by one using **Tags Review** guidelines below.
   - **To Accept A Tag As-Is:** Click the plus (+) check box next to the tag.
     ![image](../Images/Tags%20and%20Tag%20Approvals/accept.png)
   - **To Accept With Edits:** If a tag has a typo or is otherwise incorrect per the below guidelines **but is still eligible** we can edit the tag inside of the nominations. In the text box to the right of the accept and reject check boxes, type the new tag and hit tab. This will add the edited tag in place of the nominated one.
     ![image](../Images/Tags%20and%20Tag%20Approvals/edited.png)
   - **To Reject A Tag:** Click the x check box next to the tag.
     ![image](../Images/Tags%20and%20Tag%20Approvals/reject.png)
     > **NOTE:** Rejected tags cannot be edited and resubmitted. We tend to not reject until just before tag nominations close so that people can edit and resubmit their tags.
4. After you have reviewed all nominated tags *on this page* click submit.
> **NOTE:** AO3 limits the number of nominated tags shown. You may have to do this several times before all nominations are reviewed.
5. Once all tags are reviewed, return to the main tag set page. Scroll to the bottom to look for Unassociated Tags.
    - **If there are no unassociated tags:** proceed to "Updating the Spreadsheet".
    - **If there are unassociated tags:** proceed to "Unassociated Tags"

### Tags Review

When approving tags to tag sets we need to review the following:

- [ ] Does the tag meet the requirement of the exchange, i.e. is there an elf?, is
      it poly?, etc.

- [ ] Does the tag meet our nominations requirements?

  - **Both**

    - [ ] Do OCs/PCs have a gender and last name/origin i.e. Female Hawke, Male
          Tabris (not Male Warden)?

    - [ ] Do general OCs end in `(s)`, i.e. Original Grey Warden Character(s),
          Pride Demon(s), Agent(s) of Fen'harel?

  - **Arlathan**

    - [ ] Is a character tag listed as Character (Solo), i.e. Solas (Solo)?

- [ ] If there is a canon tag, has it been selected? (Check to see if there are
      AO3 suggestions.)

- [ ] Are character names spelled correctly? (This error can be caught by the
      spreadsheet and corrected on the backend, but try to catch it upfront if
      possible!)

- [ ] Do tags fit the below **Tags Formatting** guidelines?

If there are questions about tags, refer to [More Specifics](#more-specifics) and [Tags Troubleshooting](#tags-troubleshooting) below.

#### Tags Formatting

Characters are placed in the tag alphabetically by:

- Last Name (including protagonists; ignore Female/Male/Nonbinary except for
  when last name is the same)
  - Mac Tir is treated as compound
  - Orlesian ‘de’ names are not treated as compound (‘Chalons’ not ‘de Chalons’)
  - A character with ‘of X’ is alphabetized as ‘X’, e.g. ‘Serault’ for Frederic
    of Serault
  - Adorno Ciel Otranto is ‘Otranto’

- Single Name
  - Ignore titles (Cauthrien, not Ser Cauthrien) unless character name is _only_
    a title (His Dour Lordship)
  - Ser Pounce-a-Lot is ordered by his full name (‘Ser’ not ‘Pounce’)
  - Ignore ‘The’ for all characters (The Iron Bull is ordered as ‘Iron Bull’)
  - Descriptors do not count as last names (‘Svarah Sun-Hair’ not 'Sun-Hair')

- Original characters are ordered as ‘O’
  - All original characters should have Character(s) to finish the name, i.e.
    Original Templar Character(s)

- Type of Demon/Spirit needs to be specified and have (s); does not need to have
  Original
  - The _specific_ spirit in Solas’ quest is ‘Wisdom’; other such spirits are
    Wisdom Spirit(s)

- Possessives are in alphabetical order, e.g., Hawke’s Mabari is treated as
  coming right after all other Hawkes.

- Groups are also in alphabetical order, e.g., Agent(s) of Fen'harel are
  alphabetized with 'A' and Inquisition Scout(s) are alphabetized with 'I'.

#### More Specifics

_For Black Emporium:_

- Fen’Harel is treated as synonymous with Solas (no evidence that they were ever
  two distinct people).

- Mythal and Flemeth can be nominated as two separate characters (since Flemeth
  took on the mantle of Mythal).

_For Arlathan eXchange and DA Poly Exchange:_

- Fen'Harel and Solas can be requested as two entities (for time travel
  shenanigans or magical accidents). i.e. Fen'harel/Female Lavellan/Solas can be
  nominated as an eligible tag.

- Mythal and Flemeth can also be nominated as two separate characters

#### Tags Troubleshooting

- You can look up the AO3 canonical tags for characters by using [Tags Search](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/search). This is especially useful if you are questioning how the character is listed in a nominated tag.

  - If you find misspellings or duplicate tags, please send [AO3 support](https://archiveofourown.org/support) an message. Dragon Age tag wranglers are used to getting reports from me at this point.
    - Note that it is not a duplicate tag unless the tags do not "roll-up" to the canonical tag. We always want to try to use the primary canonicaly accepted tag (i.e. Male Hawke and not Garrett Hawke)

- If you are unsure about a character, use the
    [wiki](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Age_Wiki) to determine race for eligibility for Arlathan eXchange, spelling of name, or other nomination details.

## Unassociated Tags
1. Scroll to the bottom of the tag set to see if there are "Unassociated Tags". These are tags that currently do not exist anywhere on AO3 (in any other tag set or used) associated with the fandom they were nominated under.
![image](../Images/Tags%20and%20Tag%20Approvals/unassociated.png)
2. To associated the tags to `Dragon Age - All Media Types` So that they work for matching, click on the "Review Associations" button.
3. Scroll through the list to make sure all tags are being associated to `Dragon Age - All Media Types`.
   - **If so:** Click on "All" to select all. Then click "Submit".
   - **If not:** Reach out to enigmalea so we can figure out what to do!

## Updating the Spreadsheet
Once you've batch loaded or approved tags, you will need to update the Nominations Spreadsheet. Follow the below steps:

1. Click "Expand All" on one of the media type sections.
![image](../Images/Tags%20and%20Tag%20Approvals/expandall.png)
2. Copy all the tags listed and paste them into the "Tags" tab of the spreadsheet. Sheets recognizes the list as comma separated and loads them correctly.
> *Note:* If there are existing tags I like to delete them first so we can make sure there are no issues pasting.
3. On the "AutoFormat" menu click "Sort Tags".
> *Note:* The first time you run the script you might need to 
4. When the script finishes, from the "AutoFormat" men click "Separate ALL".
5. Watch the magic happen.
6. When the script finishes, scroll through to make sure no names are red. Red names mean there is either a typo or a new character.
7. On all of the sheets, select everything and double click one of the column lines to auto re-size the columns.
8. Add any rejected tags to "CORRECTIONS NEEDED" with an explanation of corrections needed to have them accepted.
