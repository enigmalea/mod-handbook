# âœ¨Creators Have Been Revealed!âœ¨

<@&946087296829124643>

**Creators, you can start claiming your works!** You can add your works to personal collections and series on AO3, thank your betas, link to your social media accounts, swap out unsigned art, and/or share your work(s) on social media! 

Feel free to tag @arlathanxchange and we will share your works on our account! If your work contains healthy polyamory, you can also tag @dapolyshipping and we will reblog it over there. 

**Reminders & Info**

â˜† If you haven't already, please make sure to comment on your main gift! While you are not *required* to comment on treats, if you cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main gift, you should comment on both. **It is good etiquette to comment on all gifts received.**

â˜† **The collection will remain open for treats!** You can post treats to any of the Arlathan eXchange collections at any time.

â˜† The mods of Arlathan eXchange will also be hosting the DA Poly Exchange for healthy polyamory! Follow us on Tumblr at [@dapolyshipping](https://www.tumblr.com/dapolyshipping) for upcoming announcements and event info.

Thank you so much to all of our participants! We hope you had fun and that you'll join us again next yearðŸ’š
