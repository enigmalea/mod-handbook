# About Nominations

```markdown
# Nomination Reminders

<@&946087296829124643> Hello everyone! With just under a week left in the nominations period, we wanted to share a few reminders about nominations for this exchange:

→ Tags **must** be nominated to the 2024 tagset if you want to use them in your sign-up. Canonical tags are not included by default and while some tags were carried over from previous years' exchanges, many were not. Double-check that your favorite is part of the 2024 tagset! 

→ Nominating tags does **not** mean you have to sign up for the exchange! Even if you're not participating, you can nominate tags to encourage others to create for ships you like. You can also nominate ships that you might want to create treats for!

→ Tags must include at least one Elvhen character to be accepted and OC/PC characters must include a gender & background (i.e. Female Surana, Male Lavellan)

→ You are not limited to existing canonical tags! As long as your tag meets our other requirements, you can manually type it into the nominations box and we will add it to the tagset. Go wild, rarepair and minor NPC lovers! :raised_hands:

For more details, see our Nominations Tutorial here: [How to Nominate](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/nominate). You can also <#946087298502639662> if you have any questions! Or ask questions anonymously via our Tumblr askbox: [Anon ask](https://arlathanxchange.tumblr.com/ask).

## REMINDERS

☆ **Be careful when editing your sign up!! AO3 has been known to add "Additional Tags" to your selections.** This means that if you go back in to edit, it may select "Fanart", "Fanfiction", or other tags that you did not want. If you edit your sign up, please check your requests carefully to make sure they are accurate. If you discover an issue AFTER assignments go out, please let a mod know immediately.

☆ **If you signed up with any Treats related tag on your OFFERS, please do the mods a favor and remove those tags.** We would really appreciate your help with that!

☆ **Creators are not required to follow provided prompts, so please do not expect prompts to keep you "safe" from your triggers, squicks, etc.** Because of this, it is *highly recommended* that you include Do Not Wants or a letter listing them in each request. Please try to make DNWs as specific as possible. 

☆ **If you are requesting a tag with an OC and are asking for a specific OC,** please be sure to include a link to information and/or art references for that OC.

☆ **Don't forget you can tailor your offers to requests that have already been made.** Offering ships that are already being requested will help ensure that you receive a match!

 **__If you have questions before signing up you can:__**
  ☆ [check out the sign-up tutorial!](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/signups>)

# Comment Reminder
```markdown

# Reminder to Comment! 

<@&946087296829124643> As we gear up for creator reveals tomorrow, please make sure you've left a comment of at least one sentence on your main gift! While you are not *required* to comment on treats, if you cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main gift, you should comment on both. **It is good etiquette to comment on all gifts received.** 

Leaving comments can be difficult, so gif responses and memes are okay, but if you use those, please also add a few words to thank your creator for their hard work!

Please see our website, [FAQs: Help! I didn't get a comment!](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/faqs#no-comment>), for more information on comments and commenting requirements.
