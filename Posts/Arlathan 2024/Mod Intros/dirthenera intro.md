# ✨ Meet the Mods ✨

Introducing the final new mod rounding out the Arlathan eXhange team!

## ☆ Mod Intro

▸ Name: DirThenera, or Thenera. Dir is ok too 
▸ Pronouns: she/her

I discovered Dragon Age in 2018 during a difficult time of my life, and quickly became obsessed, especially with all things Elvhen. Soon just the game wasn't enough for me and I dusted off my rusty drawing skills and rustier writing skills. 

Mostly obsessed with Solas, I've written a couple hundred thousand words of fic, mostly bittersweet with some snark. I love deep lore dives and angst and character explorations. 

As a painter, I love complex colors and unusual lighting, and seeing if I can capture the essence of the character. I hate doing backgrounds, but it's a skill I've been working on. Portraits are my favorite. 

I can't wait for Dreadwolf, and I'm excited to celebrate elves with all of you in the meantime!
