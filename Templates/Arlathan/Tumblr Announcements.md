A golden magical light flies around the text wrapping around it and sparkling as if by magic.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/de1ae21afa87b6cf474653cece168054/1a2d137a6ddf5bdb-6c/s640x960/c6cdecfccbae426b77f6b48ed84f83ba684bcbe8.gif)

# Nomination Reminders:

Hi all! With just under a week left in the nominations period, we wanted to share a few reminders about nominations for this exchange:

→ Tags **must** be nominated to the 2024 tagset if you want to use them in your sign-up. Canonical tags are not included by default and while some tags were carried over from previous years' exchanges, many were not. Double-check that your favorite is part of the 2024 tagset! 

→ Nominating tags does **not** mean you have to sign up for the exchange! Even if you're not participating, you can nominate tags to encourage others to create for ships you like. You can also nominate ships that you might want to create treats for!

→ Tags must include at least one Elvhen character to be accepted and OC/PC characters must include a gender & background (i.e. Female Surana, Male Lavellan)

→ You are not limited to existing canonical tags! As long as your tag meets our other requirements, you can manually type it into the nominations box and we will add it to the tagset. Go wild, rarepair and minor NPC lovers! :raised_hands:

For more details, see our Nominations Tutorial here: [How to Nominate](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/nominate). You can also ask questions in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/F73NDYMeGC) or anonymously via our Tumblr askbox: [Anon ask](https://arlathanxchange.tumblr.com/ask).

#Two Days Left to Sign-Up!!

![alt text](promo meme link)

Don't miss out on the only Dragon Age fan works exchange designed to celebrate all elves in the fandom! Sign ups will close in 48 hours, so make sure to complete your sign up and any edits you'd like to make. 

## ✨ [**SIGN UP HERE**](#link#) ✨

## REMINDERS 

☆ **Be careful when editing your sign up!! AO3 has been known to add "Additional Tags" to your selections.** This means that if you go back in to edit, it may select "Fanart", "Fanfiction", or other tags that you did not want it to. If you edit your sign up, please double-check your requests very carefully to make sure they are accurate. If you discover an issue AFTER assignments go out, please let a mod know immediately.

☆ **If you signed up with any Treats related tag on your OFFERS, please do the mods a favor and remove those tags.** We would really appreciate your help with that! 

☆ **Creators are not required to follow provided prompts, so please do not expect prompts to keep you "safe" from your triggers, squicks, etc.** Because of this, it is *highly recommended* that you include Do Not Wants or a letter listing them in each request. Please try to make DNWs as specific as possible. 

☆ **If you are requesting a tag with an OC and are asking for a specific OC,** please be sure to include a link to information and/or art references for that OC.

☆ **Don't forget you can tailor your offers to requests that have already been made.** Choosing to offer ships that are already being requested will help to ensure that you'll receive a match!

## Reminders

- **Check out our tutorials:**
    - [How to Fulfill Your Assignment](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/fulfill) - includes how to find & edit your assignment before works are revealed
    - [Keeping it Anon](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/anon)
    - [Giving Treats](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/treats/#how-do-i-give-a-treat)
- **You don't *have* to follow your recipient's provided prompts if none speak to you.** You are only required to stick to pairings requested and respect their DNWs.
- **Artists:** be sure not to use a watermark or signature that identifies you on your initial post! You can create a signed copy to swap out once creators are revealed, if you want. 
- **Do not add your work to any collections or series that might identify you! Likewise, do not link to your social media until after creator reveals.**
- **Be sure not to share snippets, WIPs, or post about your work until after creator reveals.** You *may* use betas, of course, but be sure it's someone who can keep your secret! Be careful when requesting a beta - revealing details of your piece or thanking the beta for their work could give you away. We encourage you to do so **after** creator reveals! 
- **Contact a mod if you need more info/clarification for an assignment or treat**, if you cannot find your recipient's social media or they do not have anon on. 
- **Contact a mod immediately if you will not be able to complete your assignment for any reason.** You can also request an extension [here](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/extension).

**Other reminders, helpful tutorials, and contact info below the cut!**

☆ **Tutorials:** [How to Fulfill Your Assignment](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/fulfill>) (includes instructions for finding your works before they are revealed) and [Keeping it Anon](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/tutorials/anon>)

☆ You don't have to follow your recipient's provided prompts if none speak to you. You are only required to stick to pairings requested and respect their DNWs.

☆ **Artists:** be sure not to use a watermark or signature that identifies you on your initial post! You can create a signed copy to swap out once creators are revealed, if you want.

☆ **Do not add your work to any collections or series that might identify you! Likewise, do not link to your social media until after creator reveals.**

☆ **Be sure not to share snippets, WIPs, or post about your work until after creator reveals.** You may use betas, of course, but be sure it's someone who can keep your secret! Be careful when requesting a beta - revealing details of your piece or thanking the beta for their work could give you away. We encourage you to do so after creator reveals!

☆ Contact a mod if you need more info/clarification for an assignment or treat, if you cannot find your recipient's social media or they do not have anon on.

## Treatless List

# #YEAR# Treatless List is Live!

If you're interested in creating treats and would like to focus on participants who have not yet received one, our #YEAR# Treatless List is now available!

[View the Treatless List here!](#LINK TO TREATLESS LIST#)

☆ Treats are works created in addition to your assignment - they are extra gifts! Treats can be gifted to one person, multiple people, or the exchange as a whole, depending on who has requested the pairing you create for and the recipients' DNWs.

☆ Treats have relaxed requirements for length and style! [Check out our FAQs for specific guidelines](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/faqs#treats)

☆ For more information on treats, check out our [Treats & Treatless FAQ](https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/treats)

If you have any questions, feel free to #ask the mods or send us an ask on Tumblr! If your question is about a specific individual circumstance, please send us an email.

## Comment Reminder
```markdown

# Reminder to Comment! 

As we gear up for creator reveals, please make sure you've left a comment of at least one sentence on your main gift! While you are not *required* to comment on treats, if you cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main gift, you should comment on both. **It is good etiquette to comment on all gifts received.** 

Leaving comments can be difficult, so gif responses and memes are okay, but if you use those, please also add a few words to thank your creator for their hard work!

Please see our website, [FAQs: Help! I didn't get a comment!](<https://arlathanxchange.neocities.org/docs/faqs#no-comment>), for more information on comments and commenting requirements.
